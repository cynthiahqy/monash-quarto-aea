# Meeting AEA Replication standards using Quarto and GitHub

Materials for **Meeting AEA Replication standards using Quarto and GitHub** workshop presented Jul 18-20 for the Department of Economics, Monash University

## Workshop Abstract

This workshop aims to enable participants to adapt existing projects and workflows to meet AEA Replication standards and other similar data and code availability guidelines. Participants will learn how to use features from Quarto markdown to organise code scripts and data analysis into an AEA standard Replication Package, and how to publish a companion website via GitHub Pages.

In this workshop, participants will:

-   improve their understanding of AEA replication standards

-   learn to include coding scripts (STATA, MATLAB, R, Python etc.), tables, figures, citations and mathematical equations in Quarto documents

-   produce a replication package and website using a provided Quarto template

-   learn how to publish a replication website online using GitHub Pages

-   *(optional)* learn about additional Quarto features such as presentation slides and custom document styling

Quarto is an open-source framework for authoring scientific and technical documents in formats such as HTML, PDF, MS Word, and more. GitHub Pages is a free, lightweight solution for publishing websites online.
