# Meeting AEA Replication standards using Quarto and GitHub

Materials for **Meeting AEA Replication standards using Quarto and
GitHub** workshop presented Jul 18-20 for the Department of Economics,
Monash University

## Workshop Abstract

This workshop aims to enable participants to adapt existing projects and
workflows to meet AEA Replication standards. Participants will learn how
to use features from Quarto markdown to organise code scripts and data
analysis according to the Data and Code Availability Standard \[Version
1.0\] (Koren et al. 2022), and how to publish a companion website via
GitHub Pages.

In this workshop, participants will:

- improve their understanding of AEA replication standards

- learn to include coding scripts (STATA, MATLAB, R, Python etc.),
  tables, figures, citations and mathematical equations in Quarto
  documents

- produce a replication package and website using a provided Quarto
  template

- learn how to publish a replication website online using GitHub Pages

- *(optional)* learn about additional Quarto features such as
  presentation slides and custom document styling

Quarto is an open-source framework for authoring scientific and
technical documents in formats such as HTML, PDF, MS Word, and more.
GitHub Pages is a free, lightweight solution for publishing websites
online.
