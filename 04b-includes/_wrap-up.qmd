## Reusing Content

::: incremental
- There are multiple ways to generate, combine and re-use content in Quarto

## Syntax Highlighting

Add `.stata` to code-blocks to activate syntax highlighting:

````{.md code-line-numbers="1"}
```{.stata}
use "C:\data\data-sets\GSS2016.dta"
tab postlife
tab postlife sex,column 
```
````

## Shortcodes and Filters
