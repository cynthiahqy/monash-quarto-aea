# Theming

## Theme options

-   One of 25 [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) themes

-   Custom themes

-   A combination of the two

## Setting the theme

In `_quarto.yml`:

``` yaml
format:
  html:
    theme: default
```

## Dark mode

Setting a light and dark theme makes both available with a toggle automatically added to your website:

``` yaml
format:
  html:
    theme:
      light: flatly
      dark: darkly
```

## Customizing themes

To customize a theme, add a custom `.scss` file that is then called in `_quarto.yml`, e.g.:

``` yaml
format:
  html:
    theme:
      light: [flatly, custom.scss]
      dark: darkly
```

## SCSS files

SCSS files have the following form:

``` scss
/*-- scss:defaults --*/
$h2-font-size:          1.6rem !default;
$headings-font-weight:  500 !default;
$body-color:            $gray-700 !default;

/*-- scss:rules --*/
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  text-shadow: -1px -1px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, .3);
}
```

-   The `defaults` section is where you list variables

-   The `rules` section is where you list (CSS) rules

## SASS variables

-   Some examples include:

    -   `$body-bg`: The page background color.

    -   `$link-color`: The link color.

    -   `$font-family-monospace`: The monospace font family for the page.

    -   `$callout-color-<type>`: The colors for the various types of callouts.

-   See the full list at <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#sass-variables>.

## Tip

::: callout-tip
## Figuring out what to style

-   Use your browser's developer tools.

-   Refer to the [default values for SASS variables](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/scss/_variables.scss) and set to something absurd (red and bold or giant size) while testing. Once you have the correct variable or rule identified, set the style values to what you want them to be.
:::

-   Change the theme of your project to one of the Bootswatch themes.
