# ASIDE: Revisiting Tools

## Git and GitHub {.medium}

::: incremental
- Git is version control tool that offers
    - time-travel with messages not just timestamps
    - version branching for testing new features (i.e. a new website theme)
    - file conflict resolutions

- GitHub is an online cloud-based platform for storing and sharing git repositories (i.e. projects). It also offers:
    - free publishing of websites via GitHub pages
    - project management tools like Issues, Discussions and Wikis
:::

## Operating System Issues

::: incremental
- On Windows [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html) is required to compile the R package `tinytex` for the PDF format
- An alternative to rendering PDFs locally (on your computer) is using the `latex` format instead and uploading the file to [Overleaf](http://overleaf.com/)
- Quarto might not have permission to create, move or delete files on cloud drives (e.g. Dropbox). This will causes rendering to fail. Move the files to a local non-cloud drive and try again.

## Quarto vs. RMarkdown, Juypter Notebooks...

Why Quarto?

::: incremental
- it supports all the other formats you might need!
- new features are being added all the time
- upfront investment for time-savings in the long run
